This is an explanation of the search process this skill uses. Ombi search results don't really work very well for Alexa because of the visual component. You are meant to search and select the result. This is not ideal for Alexa as it would lead to a lot of back and forth conversation just to try and select the intended movie. I added some logic to the skill to help with this. Additionally, films with numbers cause issues. Alexa converts spoken numbers to digits so "the edge of 17" will return no results but "the edge of seventeen" will work correctly. There are also issues with sequels, roman numerals, etc.
